# Battleship

This is a battleship game made in C.

Battleship is a game that consists of trying to find your enemy's ships, all placed in a square grid, to sink them. Each player starts by placing their ships on the grid to their liking.

If a player finds all of the other player's ships and sinks them, it's over.

The ships and their sizes in squares are: Carrier (5), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3) and Destroyer (2)

Their sizes and names have been based on Milton Bradley's version of the game. For more information, please refer to this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

Have fun playing the game and if there's something you don't like about it and feel like changing, feel free to do so by forking and making a pull request. :)
